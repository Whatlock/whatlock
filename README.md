# Whatlock
## Sherlock inspired stylesheet for What.CD

### Roadmap

#### Customisation

Will allow the user to generate a stylesheet based on their needs. For example, you may never use the the 'collector' feature on an artist page and therefore not need it. You can toggle features on or off and change colours etc.

#### Buffer

Integrate a _buffer_ statistic into the header. Personally, I find this much more useful than the ratio.

#### Responsive Web Design

It would be great to create a responsive stylesheet based on Whatlock. It is something that would take time. It is an idea though.


### Setup

```rake dotjs:symlink```
```rake pow:setup```

### Development

```rake stylesheets:watch```

#### How you can help

There are a list of items that I have marked as TODO throughout the
code.  You can see a list by running the following command:

```rake notes```

Would be great to see these changes fixed up and pull request sent.

### Shortcuts

```rake whatcd:thread```
