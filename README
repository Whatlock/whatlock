# Whatlock
## Sherlock inspired stylesheet for What.CD

### Roadmap

#### Customisation

Will allow the user to generate a stylesheet based on their needs. For example, you may never use the the 'collector' feature on an artist page and therefore not need it. You can toggle features on or off and change colours etc.

#### Buffer

Integrate a _buffer_ statistic into the header. Personally, I find this much more useful than the ratio.

#### Responsive Web Design

It would be great to create a responsive stylesheet based on Whatlock. It is something that would take time. It is an idea though.
