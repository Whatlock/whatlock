## Sherlock inspired stylesheet for What.CD

So as some of you may know, i am responsible for the looks of Sherlock. Since the skin was put live i have had a series of requests to make a site wide theme with similar looks to Sherlock. I already had something like this planned but a few good pushes from users finally got me in the design chair and started on it.

I will be hoping to update it regularly and have a little beta version within the next month(if time permits - new job and all...).

For now though, i am looking for feedback. I really wanna make sure this theme is easy to use and takes into consideration the people using it.

### Setup

```rake dotjs:symlink```
```rake pow:setup```

### Development

```rake stylesheets:watch```

### Shortcuts

```rake whatcd:thread```
